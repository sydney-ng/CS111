Similar to Lab 0, this project will use file descriptors that will either only open/ only write to, execute a command to a specific file descriptor, and possibly print out the commands youâ€™re executing (if the user asks for it). You also can combine these together. Error messages will be printed to the error file descriptor if errors are encountered. Now, in part 1B, we can support all the commands except for --profile. We support more opening/closing options & are able to retrieve the arguments of a commmand using --wait.
