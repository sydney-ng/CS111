Description: 
This project is designed to read input and output from either standard
input and output or from a file or to a file. The following files are used: 
1) README: contains my student info, information about the files
I wrote, and the smoke-test cases that can be used to check the code written.
2) lab0.c: a C file that contains all the code that will read/write from 
files or standard input/output. 
3) backtrace.png: a screenshot of the backtrace for the segfault
4) breakpoint.png: a screenshot of the breakpoint and variable info for 
the segfault
5) Makefile: a make file that compiles the program, has tests, and can create
A tarball

Checks: 
1) Test #1 will check the input by creating a dummy file as the input and will 
print it to standard output. This standard output is put into a file called
output1.txt. Then we will diff it with the original file to make sure 
that everything gets copied.
2) Test #2 will check the output by using the dummy file as the input and write
Output to output.txt. Then we will diff output.txt with the original dummyfile
to make sure that everything gets copied. 
3) Test #3 will check the use of segfaults by causing a segfault and then 
writing the output to a file called segmentation-og.txt. Then we will diff 
segmentation-og.txt with the expected output string from our lab0.c file 
to make sure that this segmentation error was indeed triggered.
